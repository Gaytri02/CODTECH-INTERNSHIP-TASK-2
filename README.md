Project:Student Grade Tracker

Objective:
1.Organize Grade Data: Allow users to input and store grades for different subjects or assignments in an organized manner.
2.Calculate Statistics: Compute the average grade from the entered data.
3.Grade Classification: Convert numerical average grades into letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) based on standard grading scales.
4.GPA Calculation: Calculate the Grade Point Average (GPA) based on the letter grades.

Key Activities:
1.Adding Grades:
Users can input grades for various subjects or assignments.
Each grade is associated with a specific subject to maintain organized records.

2.Calculating Average Grade:
The program computes the average grade from all the entered grades.
This provides an overall measure of the student's performance.

3.Assigning Letter Grades:
Based on the calculated average grade, the program assigns a corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
This classification follows a standard grading scale.
